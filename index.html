            <h3>World-class professional web developer</h3>
            <p>To get a quick introduction on basics for ML in JavaScript, take the self-paced course on Edx or watch the videos below that take you from first principles, to using existing pre-made models, and even building your own neural network for classification. You can also try the Make a smart webcam in JavaScript Codelab for an interactive walkthrough of these concepts.</p>
